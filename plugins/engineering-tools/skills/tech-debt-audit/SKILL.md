name: tech-debt-audit
description: Audit a codebase for actionable technical debt and maintain a deduplicated roadmap. Use when the user asks to find code smells, maintainability risks, refactoring priorities, or update an existing technical-debt backlog. Supports optional Jira ticket creation only with explicit approval. Not a substitute for a dedicated security or dependency-vulnerability audit.

# Tech Debt Audit

Find real, actionable technical debt in a codebase, then persist it as a living roadmap that
developers update over time. Default to `_docs/tech-debt-audit.md`, but honor the repository's
documentation map, project instructions, or a path supplied by the user. Call the resolved path
`<target-path>` throughout this workflow. Optionally file Jira tickets for selected items.

The value of this skill is **actionability and continuity**. A finding nobody can act on is noise; a roadmap that gets rewritten from scratch every run is useless. So two things matter above all: every finding points to a specific place and a specific change, and re-running the analysis _updates_ the existing roadmap rather than duplicating it.

## Workflow

Follow these phases in order. Phases 4 (Jira) is optional and gated on explicit user approval.

1. **Scope the codebase** — understand what you're analyzing
2. **Detect debt against the criteria** — find issues and verify evidence
3. **Reconcile with the existing roadmap** — merge into `<target-path>` without duplication
4. **Offer Jira tickets** (optional) — only if the user approves

## Phase 1 — Scope the codebase

Before hunting for issues, get oriented so findings are grounded in how _this_ project actually
works, not generic advice.

- Read the repository's agent instructions and documentation map first when they exist. Resolve
  `<target-path>` before editing anything; reuse an existing equivalent instead of creating a
  competing debt backlog.
- Identify the stack and entry points: read manifest/build files (e.g. `package.json`, `pom.xml`, `build.gradle`, `requirements.txt`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `*.csproj`), and the README.
- Map the source tree. Note the layers (controllers/handlers, services, data access, UI, config) and where the bulk of logic lives.
- Note the languages in play. This skill is language-agnostic — the criteria apply whether the code is Java, JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.

Keep this fast. Use available file listings and targeted search tools rather than reading files
wholesale. The goal is enough context to judge findings, not a full architecture review.

## Phase 2 — Detect debt against the criteria

Read `references/criteria.md` — it defines the catalog of debt criteria, each mapped to a **category** and a typical **severity**. Walk the codebase looking for instances of these criteria. You are not limited to the catalog; if you spot genuine debt that doesn't fit a listed criterion, include it and assign a sensible category and severity.

**Categories**: `performance`, `consistency`, `error-handling`, `maintainability`, `configuration`, `security`, `testing`.

**Severity** is about impact × likelihood, judged in context — not a fixed label per criterion. The same criterion can be High in one place and Low in another. Calibrate:

- **High** — can cause incorrect behavior, data loss, security exposure, or outages; or blocks development broadly. Fix soon.
- **Medium** — degrades maintainability, performance, or correctness under load/edge cases; worth scheduling.
- **Low** — cleanliness, consistency, and minor risks. Fix opportunistically.

Each finding MUST be actionable. A reader should know exactly where to look and what to change. Capture for every finding:

- **Location** — `path/to/file.ext:line` (or a line range). If the issue is project-wide (e.g. a missing CI gate), say so and point at the most representative file or the repo root.
- **Description** — what the issue is and _why it's debt_ (the concrete risk or cost), in one or two sentences.
- **Category** — one of the categories above.
- **Severity** — High / Medium / Low, justified by the impact in this codebase.
- **Suggested fix** — the specific change to make, concrete enough to act on. Name the construct, pattern, or config to introduce. Avoid vague advice like "improve error handling".

Be honest and specific. Prefer a shorter list of real, well-located findings over a long list of generic observations. Don't invent line numbers — open the file and cite the actual location. If you're unsure a thing is debt, either verify it or leave it out.

Evidence rules:

- Treat security-related findings as concrete debt observations, not proof that the system is
  secure. Recommend a dedicated security review when the requested assurance exceeds this audit.
- Call a dependency outdated or vulnerable only when a current package-manager, lockfile,
  advisory, or vulnerability-tool check supports it. Do not infer current version status from
  model memory.
- Treat missing tests or performance risks in context. Verify critical paths and expected scale
  before assigning severity.

## Phase 3 — Reconcile with the existing roadmap

The output lives at `<target-path>`. Create its parent directory and file only when no equivalent
exists. This file is a **roadmap that persists across runs** — developers fix items and update
statuses. Merge new findings in **without creating duplicates**.

Read `references/report-format.md` for the exact document template and the dedup procedure. The essentials:

- The document groups findings by severity (High → Medium → Low). Each severity section is a table; **category is a column**, so related items stay visible together within a priority band.
- Before adding a finding, check whether it already exists (same location + same underlying issue). If it does, **do not add a second row** — instead reconcile: refresh the description/fix if your analysis is better, and leave its Status and Jira columns intact. Never resurrect or overwrite an item a developer has marked `Done`/`Won't fix` unless the issue genuinely recurs.
- Preserve human edits. The Status column and any Jira links are owned by developers — treat existing values as source of truth and don't clobber them.
- If code evidence suggests an existing item may be resolved or recurring, report it and propose
  the status change. Do not change a developer-owned status without approval.
- When you finish, give the user a short summary: how many findings are new, how many already existed, the severity breakdown.

## Phase 4 — Offer Jira tickets (optional)

This phase is **opt-in** and requires Jira tooling to be available. Before offering this to the user, check whether any Jira MCP tool is present in your environment (look for tools with names like `jira`, `create_issue`, `mcp__jira*`). If none is found, skip the offer entirely — just note that Jira integration is unavailable if the user asks.

If Jira tooling is available: after updating the doc, ask the user — clearly and once — whether they want to create Jira tickets for any of the findings. If they decline or don't respond affirmatively, **skip this entirely**; the doc stands on its own and the skill is complete.

If they say yes, follow `references/jira-integration.md`. The essentials:

- Let the user choose _which_ findings get tickets (e.g. "all High", "these three", a specific list). Don't bulk-create without that choice.
- Create a ticket per selected finding, mapping its location/description/severity/fix onto the issue. If Jira can't be reached, tell the user and stop — don't fabricate ticket URLs.
- After each ticket is created, write its URL into that finding's **Jira** column in
  `<target-path>`, so the roadmap links to the tracker.
